<h2>Open Nexus: (WIP)</h2>
<p><strong>Requires:</strong> <br />MySQL 5.7.37 (since version 8 will throw password error)</p>
<p><strong>What Transferes:</strong>
<br>BasePlayer - stats, Inventory, Modifiers, Blueprints, Skins, Keys
<br>BaseVehicle - stats, Inventory, Seats, Bags, Modules
<br>Plugins - Backpacks, Inventory, Economics Balance, ServerRewards Points, ZLevels
<br>Server - DateTime,Weather,Lock player to 1 server at time
<p><strong>Database setup: <br /></strong>Create a database, Create a username/password to use with it.<br />Enter these settings into the plugin. It will create the tables on its own.<br />You have to use standard type password since thats all the Oxide.Mysql supports.<br /><br /><strong>Plugin setup:</strong> <br />Default settings should work best but theres other adjustments provided within the plugin. They have been commented to descript what they do.<br />Changing <strong>ShowDebugMsg </strong>to false will remove all the debug messages from console.<br />But its best to have it on while this is still a work in progress so if something goes wrong you can work it out from log.<br /><br /><strong>Permissions: </strong><br />Giving users permission "OpenNexus.bypass" will allow them to join other servers on the open nexus when they already have a body on one. Other wise by default no matter which one they join they will spawn on last server they were on.<br /><br /><strong>Map Setup</strong>:<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DONT PLACE THE "Nexusferry Entity" or "Islandmarker"</span><br /><br />You need to place down a Nexusdock in a map editor such as RustEdit.<br />If your using Unity or other editor that supports changing the prefab category change it to this layout.<br /><br />SERVER=ipaddress,PORT=portnumber,name<br /><br />Replace ipaddress with the IP address of the server you want to be redirected to.<br />Replace portnumber with the port number of that server.<br />Enter what ever you want in the name as long as its different from any other Docks placed on the nexus servers.<br />You will want to also cover this dock in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prevent Building</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Save Zone.</span> So players are safe while waiting.<br />For it to activate it will need to see another Nexus dock ponting back to this server on the one you have set up redirect too.<br /><br />If your using RustEdit you create a custom prefab group and use that layout as the name of it. Make sure you tick "Convert Selection To Group"<br /><br /><img src="https://i.ibb.co/g40HbNq/Dock-Screen-Shot.jpg" alt="DockScreenShot" width="640" height="442" /><br /><br />If you want to add a Nexus Island in the distance you can.<br />For this to work you need to have it with in the radius of the map.<br />Such as if you use 1000 size map. Then you can only go to a max of 999 on X or Z axis.<br />If it goes outside of this it will just be invisable. Its image is offset from the actual position you can can rotate it to have it show a bit further away.<br />You should also drop its height down a bit with the Y axis so it doesnt look like its floating in the disatance -18f is a starting good value.<br /><img src="https://i.ibb.co/W6b6T48/Island-Screenshot.jpg" alt="IslandScreenShot" /></p>
